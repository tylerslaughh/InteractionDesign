      <h2>Won't You Celebrate With Me: By Lucille Clifton</h2>
      <p>Won't you celebrate with me
what i have shaped into
a kind of life? i had no model.
born in babylon
both nonwhite and woman
what did i see to be except myself?
i made it up
here on this bridge between
starshine and clay,
my one hand holding tight
my other hand; come celebrate
with me that everyday
something has tried to kill me
and has failed.

    <h2>Winter Morning: By James Crews</h2>
<p>When I can no longer say thank you
for this new day and the waking into it,
for the cold scrape of the kitchen chair
and the ticking of the space heater glowing
orange as it warms the floor near my feet,
I know it’s because I’ve been fooled again
by the selfish, unruly man who lives in me
and believes he deserves only safety
and comfort. But if I pause as I do now,
and watch the streetlights outside flashing
off one by one like old men blinking their
cloudy eyes, if I listen to my tired neighbors
slamming car doors hard against the morning
and see the steaming coffee in their mugs
kissing chapped lips as they sip and
exhale each of their worries white into
the icy air around their faces—then I can
remember this one life is a gift each of us
was handed and told to open: Untie the bow
and tear off the paper, look inside
and be grateful for whatever you find
even if it is only the scent of a tangerine
that lingers on the fingers long after
you’ve finished peeling it.</p>

<h2>Danielle's Dad: By Rachel Long</h2>
<p>Has magical pockets.
People come from all over the estate.
They pay and hurry away.
We watch from our bedroom window,
through bunkbed bars, we pretend we're in prison.
We ask Danielle, What sort of magic?
She says, Dunno.
Danielle is not very clever.
She thinks the Woolwich Ferry is the Titanic.
Look! She said as we drove around the roundabout,
The Titanic!
Even Mum pretended not to laugh.
When Danielle is playing over,
we can only play cheat-Scrabble
as she isn't very good at spellings or maths either.
We just write our names
then add our letters together.
Out of Rachel, Maria and Danielle,
I am the winner.
Sometimes, Danielle's dad reaches into his pocket
and yanks out a black Lab puppy called Bo.
Or a quadbike for JJ.
Or lacy pink curtains for their screaming mum.
But most often Danielle's dad yanks out fistfuls of coins .
The most coins I've ever seen in a real-life hand .
When we're playing out with Danielle, he'll say,
Oi, ghels, go get some iscream or sumfink.
We cheer, we shout, Thank you, Danielle's dad!
He doesn't even count it, just pours the thick gold
into our cupped hands till they bubble over.
We skip towards the ice cream man.
When we pay, we remember to cover our boobs
with our other hand. We don't take a lick
till we're back behind the garages.
As he kisses my earlobe before bed,
I tell Dad, Danielle's dad is richer than you.
Hmm, I bet he is, Dad says.</p>

<h2>Garden: By Isabel Duarte-Grey</h2>
<p>To be pretty for you I have dropped
two seeds of turnsole in the dark
of both eyes. I grafted
apple to the quickest
vein in either wrist. I dug a ounce
of poppyseeds where
teeth should be, plugged
my ears with golden balls
of iris. I carved a hole in
either breast to swaddle
dahlias overwinter, like you, so
frightened of the cold.

My mouth grows hot with
purring, with the tunneling of
bees. My tongue, become a catacomb
the wings will fill
with scent.

My skull, for you,
ceramic bowl of flowers you may
hurl against the wall.

I am ready. Lead the way.</p>
