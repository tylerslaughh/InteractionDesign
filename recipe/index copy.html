      <h2>Ingredients</h2>

          <li>Frozen berries of your choosing</li>
          <li>1 Spoonful of Almond Butter</li>
          <li>A splash of Oat Milk</li>
          <li>2 Cups of Spinach</li>

  <body>Instructions</body>
          <li> To start the recipe, begin by adding all of the dry ingredients. I start with the spinach then the protein powder then the almond butter, cinnamon and oat milk. Blend these ingredients together. You will get a watery substance. Finally, add the frozen fruit. You add the fruit last to protect the blades of your blender. Once it is all blended, pour into a glass and enjoy:)</li>
