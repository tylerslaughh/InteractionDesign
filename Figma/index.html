    <h3>What I use to Cook</h3>
    <p>
Hi! My name is Tyler and I am no pro chef, but I can cook some yummy noms!
  <p>
  The first nom description I am going to talk about is how to make a simple stir fry. In my apartment, my roomate and I cook this easy meal at least once a week! All you need is some jasmine rice, teryaki marinated chicken (cut into bite sized bits) mushrooms, red peppers, onions, garlic, broccoli, and soyaki sauce. This meal is so easy because once the rice is cooked and you finish mixing all the said ingredients on a stove top, you combine together and you're all done! Super easy, fast, and deliicious!
</p>
<p>
Now I am going to describe my version of the "Gigi Hadid Vodka Pasta". Get your favorite pasta, mine is rigatoni, and cook that pasta. While it is slowly cooking, you will need tomato paste, garlic, onion, salt and pepper, heavy cream, red pepper flakes, and a LOT of cheese. This is super fast and easy as well and it will never dissapoint!
</p>
<p>
It is time for lemon chicken! I use an air fryer for my chicken because of my numerous failed attempts at cooking chicken on the stove. Anway.. take your chicken breast and give it a nice massage with some olive oil and lemon. Then you are going to throw some salt and pepper onto the breast. I cook the chicken with two whole lemons to let it soak in all the juices. I know this doesn't seem very comlpex, and it isn't, but it has taken me some time to get that perfect citrusy taste!
</p>
<p>
The salmon avocado bowl is a weekly staple! I can't take credit for this one because tik tok gave me the inspiration, but it is amazing! I marinate my salmon in soyaki for about 25 minutes so it is really juicy. While doing this I cook my sushi rice on the stove. I put the salmon in the air fryer for about 19 minutes and prep the rest of my toppings. I slice up and avocado and get out some seaweed. I mix all of this together and throw on some soy sauce and hot sauce. This meal is always so filling and so yummy!!
</p>
<p>
Last but not least, we have the avocado toast. I eat this for breakfast a lot because it is super quick, yummy, and filling. I first toast two pieces of sourdough bread, then I get started on my avo mash. I put an avocado in a bowl and mash it up. I will throw in some salt, pepper, olive oil, balsamic, and everything bagel seasoning. Once the bread has popped out of the toaster, I spread my mash and enjoy!
